= LuaTeX Performance

== Introduction

We noticed degrading performance on long documents processed with LuaTeX. This
simplified sample is a minimal working example to show that once the document is
in the four-figure page range, the performance drops significantly. 

We have the impression that this has not always been the case. Currently, it
seems that some time in late 2021 a change has been made that the processing
speed became worse.

This sample simulates our production document. It is almost 3.000 pages long and consists of several hundred `longtable` environments.

Run `lualatex test` to build the sample.

== Setup

`test.tex` defines the testing framework and time measuring. It includes
`testcase.tex` several hundred times. Change number of iterations by adjusting
the loop in `test.tex`. `testcase.tex` is a sample document of arbitrary
complexity.

At the end of processing, `test.tex` prints a table with the timing results for
each lap. A lap consists of (by default) 100 inclusions of `testcase.tex`. The
times printed for each lap are the number of seconds it took to process this lap
and the number of seconds elapsed since the start. Time measuring is done by
calling Lua's `os.time()` function, which returns whole seconds.

We tested this sample with two different installations of TeX Live. Both are packaged in Docker images. The shell scripts `run-fast.sh` and `run-slow.sh` use those images to spawn containers and process the sample document.

== Results / Conclusion

Tests show that processing times rise exponentially when using the newer installation. With the older installation, processing times are linear.

If we reduce the complexity of the sample and throw out the `longtable` environment, the processing times are linear for both versions. 

The newer (slower) installation uses `longtable` in version v4.17 (dated 2021-09-01), while the older (faster) installation has v4.16 (2021-05-07). 

On the surface it seems that the update to longtable from v4.16 to v4.17 has introduced a regression that causes long documents with hundreds of `longtable` environments to degrade in performance.

However, after further investigation it turns out that this is not the case. Manually copying the newer version of `longtable` into the faster container does not cause the build to slow down. Vice versa, the older version of `longtable` in the slower container results in non-linear build time.

From what we ca n deduce here, it seems that `longtable` triggers some behaviour in other parts of the typesetting process that cause non-linear build times. It remains to be seen what is the cause for this.

== To Do

* List TeX Live package state to make clear, which versions are employed



== Data

All data is recorded on macOS 12.3 running on x86_64 using Docker 4.6.1
