= LuaTeX Performance

We noticed degrading performance on long documents processed with LuaTeX. This
simplified sample is a minimal working example to show that once the document is
in the four-figure page range, the LuaTeX engine drops in performance.

We have the impression that this has not always been the case. Currently, it
seems that some time in late 2021 a change has been made that the processing
speed became worse.

Run `lualatex test` to build the sample. Change number of iterations by
adjusting the loop in `test.tex`.
